### More about technology

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) -** is necessary to write more competent JavaScript code. By writing TS code correctly, we automatically document our code + our application will contain fewer bugs due to strict typing.
- **[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)** - with the help of this library, we will be able to create a global data repository for our application, thus, a more convenient way to exchange information between different components of our application. This library is being actively implemented in all large and small react projects for 2021-2022.
- **[React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/overview)** - will allow us to create navigation on our website without page reloads. You've probably noticed that a VK or Instagram site, when navigating through different sections, doesn't reload the entire page, but only a certain part of the site. This is the feature we will be implementing in our application using React Router.
- **[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)** - it will help us to interact with the server side. Send data to the server or get it if necessary from the server already in our frontend application.
- **[React Hooks](https://ru.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)** - this is a set of ready-made functions inside the React library to solve a variety of tasks, such as storing data, defining the first mapping of the application, function optimizations, etc.
- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** - our code should not only be well written, but also **beautiful**. With Prettier, our code will be automatically aligned within our code editor, thus becoming more readable.
- **[SCSS](https://sass-scss.ru/)** is the same CSS, but with more powerful features, functions, variables, loops (yes, Carl, loops in CSS) and a bunch of other cool solutions.
- **[CSS-Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)** - we'll be using SCSS along with CSS modules. In fact, you won't have to learn anything new. You'll write the same styles, but already in separate files (css-modules), thus encapsulating your CSS classes.
- **[Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs)** - a set of ready-made JS functions for a huge number of different tasks.
